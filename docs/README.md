# Brutal Maze record player

Either game played by human or client script can be recorded to JSON format.
This can be enabled by setting the output directory to a non-empty string via
command-line option `--record-dir` or `Directory` in configuration file's
`Record` section.  Recordings can be played on
[the repo's Github Page](https://McSinyx.github.io/brutalmaze/).
